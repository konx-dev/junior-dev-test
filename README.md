# Junior Dev test, May 2019

This was the test I had to complete as part of the interview process for what became my first developer position in industry. The brief was to implement a fully responsive home with a funtionally working menu. A design and all required assets were provided, was a pure front-end task gauging my ability to take a design and implement as a responsive page.
